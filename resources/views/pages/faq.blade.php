                                        If you haven’t had your house professionally cleaned for more than 3 months you need a deep clean. Deep cleaning is thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting every single spot, top or bottom which aims to remove dirt & grime. It’s about taking a step further and deep into how we clean. It also includes a sweep, vacuum, mop, disinfecting and deodorising to kill bacteria and germs.
